# gRPC Microservices Architecture Pattern

## Service Structure
Each microservice should follow this layered structure:

1. **Repository Layer**: Handles database operations
   - Implements CRUD operations
   - Manages database transactions
   - Returns domain entities

2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic
   - Orchestrates operations across repositories
   - Implements domain-specific rules
   - Manages transactions that span multiple repositories

3. **Handler Layer**: Implements gRPC interface
   - Translates between proto messages and domain entities
   - Performs input validation
   - Handles protocol-specific concerns

4. **Configuration**: Manages service settings
   - Database connections
   - External service endpoints
   - Feature toggles

## Inter-Service Communication
- Services should communicate via gRPC
- Use client-side load balancing
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience
- Follow the service discovery pattern

## Error Handling
- Use standard error codes defined in gRPC
- Include detailed error messages for debugging
- Implement proper error propagation across services
- Log errors with appropriate context
