# Next Steps for gRPC Microservices Project

## Services Implementation

### 1. Product Service
- Implement repository layer for database operations in [services/product-service](mdc:services/product-service)
- Develop handler layer for gRPC implementation based on [proto/product.proto](mdc:proto/product.proto)
- Set up configuration similar to other services

### 2. Order Service
- Complete the order service in [services/order-service](mdc:services/order-service)
- Set up gRPC client connections to User and Product services
- Implement transaction management
- Handle order operations as defined in [proto/order.proto](mdc:proto/order.proto)

### 3. Notification Service
- Finish the notification service in [services/notification-service](mdc:services/notification-service)
- Connect to email/SMS providers
- Process notification requests according to [proto/notification.proto](mdc:proto/notification.proto)

## Infrastructure and Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 4. Service Discovery
- Implement service registration using etcd
- Set up health checks
- Create dynamic service resolution

### 5. API Gateway
- Create HTTP-to-gRPC transcoding
- Implement authentication middleware
- Set up request routing to appropriate services

### 6. Authentication
- Enhance the user service with JWT token generation
- Add middleware for token validation
- Share authentication across services

### 7. Containerization
- Create Dockerfiles for each service
- Set up docker-compose.yml for local development
- Configure environment variables

### 8. Observability
- Implement structured logging with a common format
- Add Prometheus metrics
- Set up distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
